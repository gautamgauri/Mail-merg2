## üìä Managing Your Data

### Organizing Beneficiary Data

Create different CSV files for different programs:

```
ngo-data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beneficiaries-education.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beneficiaries-health.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ donors-2024.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ volunteers-active.csv
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ partners-govt.csv
```

### Sample CSV Template for NGOs

```csv
Email,Name,Phone,Village,Program,Status,LastContact,Notes
person1@example.com,Asha Devi,9876543210,Bihta,Education,Active,Oct 2024,Interested in computer training
person2@example.com,Raj Kumar,9876543211,Patna,Healthcare,Active,Sep 2024,Needs follow-up
```

**Tips:**
- Keep one main database in Excel/Google Sheets
- Export specific groups as CSV when needed
- Always backup your data!

---

## üîí Security for NGO Context

### Protecting Beneficiary Data

**Important**: Beneficiary data is sensitive!

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Keep CSV files on encrypted/password-protected computer
- Don't include sensitive info (Aadhar, bank details) in CSV
- Delete exported files after sending
- Use generic column names (avoid "HIV+", "Disability" etc.)

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Don't save beneficiary emails on shared computers
- Don't email CSV files without encryption
- Don't commit CSV files to git (already protected)

### API Key Security

Your API key is like a password. Keep it safe:

1. **Set spending limits** (recommended for NGOs):
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - Set daily quota: 100 requests (adjust as needed)
   - Set up billing alerts if using paid tier

2. **Don't share** your `.env.local` file with anyone

3. **Monitor usage** monthly: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

## üÜò Common NGO Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario: "I have data in Excel"

**Solution:**
1. Open your Excel file
2. File ‚Üí Save As ‚Üí CSV (Comma delimited)
3. Upload CSV in the tool

### Scenario: "I don't have email addresses for all beneficiaries"

**Solution:**
- Filter your data to only include people with emails
- Or use the tool to draft messages, then send via WhatsApp/SMS manually
- Export as text and copy content

### Scenario: "I need to send to 500+ people"

**Solution:**
1. Use the tool to generate all emails (export as CSV)
2. Use Gmail's mail merge add-on (free for up to 50/day)
3. Or send in batches: 50 today, 50 tomorrow

**Free bulk email options for NGOs:**
- Gmail: 50/day with free add-ons
- Outlook: 300/day
- Mailchimp: 500 contacts free (nonprofit discount available)

### Scenario: "Emails are in Hindi/regional language"

**Solution:**
The tool works with any language! Just:
1. Write your template in Hindi/regional language
2. AI can still help: "Make this more formal" (works in Hindi too)
3. CSV data can be in any language

Example:
```csv
Email,Name,Village
test@example.com,‡§Ü‡§∂‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•Ä,‡§¨‡§ø‡§π‡§ü‡§æ
```

### Scenario: "I'm not technical, this seems complicated"

**Solution:**
Don't worry! You only need to know:
1. How to open Notepad (for editing `.env.local`)
2. How to open Command Prompt
3. How to copy-paste

Everything else is point-and-click in the web interface.

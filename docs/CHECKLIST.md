Quick checklist to make sure everything is secure.

---

## ‚úÖ Already Done (Automatic)

These are already implemented and working:

- [x] API key moved to `.env.local`
- [x] `.env.local` excluded from git
- [x] API key validation on startup
- [x] Email format validation
- [x] CSV injection prevention
- [x] XSS protection in HTML output
- [x] Better error messages
- [x] Security utilities created
- [x] Documentation written

**You don't need to do anything for these!**

## üéØ Recommended Actions (5-10 minutes)

### 1. Set Up API Key Restrictions ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY

**Why?** Prevents others from using your API key even if they find it.

**How?** (5 minutes)
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your API key and click "Edit"
3. Under "Application restrictions":
   - Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
   - Click "Add an item"
   - Add: `http://localhost:3000/*`
4. Under "API restrictions":
   - Select "Restrict key"
   - Check only: "Generative Language API"
5. Click "Save"

**Status**: [ ] Done / [ ] Skipped

---

### 2. Test the Application

**Why?** Make sure everything still works after security changes.

**How?** (3 minutes)
```bash
npm install  # If not already done
npm run dev
```

Then test:
- [ ] App opens at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Can add recipients (CSV or manual)
- [ ] Can write/edit templates
- [ ] AI enhancement works (magic wand icon)
- [ ] Preview shows emails correctly
- [ ] Export works (text/CSV/HTML)
- [ ] No errors in browser console (F12)

**Status**: [ ] Done / [ ] Skipped

---

### 3. Bookmark Usage Guide

**Why?** Quick reference for features and troubleshooting.

**How?** (1 minute)
- Open `USAGE_GUIDE.md` in your editor
- Bookmark or pin it for quick access

**Status**: [ ] Done / [ ] Skipped

- [ ] Update npm packages periodically: `npm update`

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- [ ] Don't commit `.env.local` (already prevented)
- [ ] Don't share API key in screenshots/forums

## üöÄ If Deploying Online

Only if you want to deploy to Vercel/Netlify/etc:

- [ ] Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in hosting dashboard
- [ ] Update API restrictions to include deployed URL (e.g., `https://yourapp.vercel.app/*`)
- [ ] Test deployed version thoroughly
- [ ] Verify API key is NOT in deployed source code

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting Checklist

If something doesn't work:

- [ ] Check `.env.local` exists and has your API key
- [ ] Verify API key is correct (no extra spaces)
- [ ] Restart dev server (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
- [ ] Check browser console for errors (F12)
- [ ] Verify internet connection is working
- [ ] Check API usage hasn't exceeded quota
